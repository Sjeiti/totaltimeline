# Total timeline

## Project setup

The project is a pure JS application built through Webpack.

## Build

The app uses an iconfont that is placed prior to the main Webpack build.
As an afterthought a sitemap is generated and placed in the `dist` folder.

The NPM scripts are:

 - start: the watched buid and a serve task
 - build: builds
 - build:prod: does a clean, full build
 - build:sitemap: generates a sitemap.xml
 - webpack: yeah that
 - lint: eslint for clean code 
 - serve: uses Express to locally serve the app
 - json: generates JSON content files from a spreadsheet
 - clean: empties the target build folder
 - icomoon: places font files
 - icons: turn icons into base64 CSS
 - version: bumps version
