    "wikimedia": "The Eoarchean (; also spelled Eoarchaean) is the first era of the Archean Eon of the geologic record for which the Earth has a solid crust. It spans 400 million years from the end of the Hadean Eon 4 billion years ago (4000 Mya) to the start of the Paleoarchean Era 3600 Mya. The beginnings of life on Earth have been dated to this era and evidence of cyanobacteria date to 3500 Mya, just outside of this era. At that time, the atmosphere was without oxygen and the pressure values ranged from 10 to 100&nbsp;bar (around 10 to 100 atmospheres).",

    "wikimedia": "The Hadean () is a geologic eon of the Earth predating the Archean. It began with the formation of the Earth about 4.6 billion years ago and ended, as defined by the ICS, 4 billion years ago. The geologist Preston Cloud coined the term in 1972, originally to label the period before the earliest-known rocks on Earth. W. Brian Harland later coined an almost synonymous term: the \"Priscoan period\". Other, older texts simply refer to the eon as the Pre-Archean. In 2015, traces of carbon minerals interpreted as \"remains of biotic life\" were found in 4.1-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. ",

The other large basins that dominate the lunar nearside (such as Crisium, Tranquilitatis, Serenitatis, Fecunditatis, and Procellarum) were also formed in this period. These basins filled with basalt mostly during the subsequent Late Imbrian epoch. The Early Imbrian was preceded by the Nectarian.",
