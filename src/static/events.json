The model accounts for the fact that the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large scale structure and Hubble's Law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated beyond where they have been verified, there is a singularity. Some estimates place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies.","image":"Big_Bang","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png/320px-Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png","imagename":"Ilc_9yr_moll4096.png","imageinfo":"'=={{int:filedesc}}==\r{{Information\r|description={{en|1=[[:en:Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] Images\r\rIMAGES > CMB IMAGES > NINE YEAR MICROWAVE SKY\r\rhttp://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/media/121238/index.html\r\rNine Year Microwave Sky\r\rThe detailed, all-sky picture of the infant universe created from nine years of WMAP data.

However, metal-poor objects are even more primitive. These objects formed during an earlier time of the universe. Intermediate population I stars are common in the bulge near the centre of our galaxy, whereas population II stars found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters also contain high numbers of population II stars. It is thought that population II stars created all the other elements in the periodic table, except the more unstable ones. An interesting characteristic of population II stars is that despite their lower overall metallicity, they often have a higher ratio of alpha elements (O, Si, Ne, etc.) relative to Fe as compared to population I stars; current theory suggests this is the result of Type II supernovae being more important contributors to the interstellar medium at the time of their formation, whereas Type Ia supernovae metal enrichment came later in the universe's evolution.","image":"Star","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Starsinthesky.jpg/320px-Starsinthesky.jpg","imagename":"Starsinthesky.jpg","imageinfo":"'== {{int:filedesc}} ==\r{{Information\r|Description={{en|1=The image is from the European Space Agency.

The galaxy cluster appears to be undergoing the transformation from a galaxy cluster that is still forming, a proto-cluster, to a mature cluster, and it is the first such cluster observed in this stage of its evolution. The cluster consists of seventeen galaxies, and nine of the eleven massive galaxies closest to its centre have new stars forming in them at a very high rate, equivalent to about 3,400 Suns per year. In contrast, the Milky Way produces only the equivalent of one Sun per year, so these galaxies at the core of the cluster are producing stars at a rate three hundred times greater than the Milky Way on average. Other galaxy clusters at ten billion light years and closer have far less star formation, and this suggests that star formation slows down in large galaxies within clusters after the galaxies have already come together during the development of a galaxy cluster.","image":"CL J1001+0220","thumb":"#NAME?","imagename":"","imageinfo":"","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":""},{"ago":"11000000000","since":"","year":"","accuracy":"","name":"first galaxies","exclude":"1","importance":"","icon":"galaxy","category":"celestial","tags":"","wikimediakey":"","explanation":"","wikimedia":"","image":"","thumb":"#NAME?","imagename":"","imageinfo":"","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":"13.2 billion y"},{"ago":"10600000000","since":"","year":"","accuracy":"","name":"spiral galaxy","exclude":"","importance":"","icon":"galaxy","category":"celestial","tags":"","wikimediakey":"BX442","explanation":"","wikimedia":"BX442 (Q2343-BX442) is a grand design spiral galaxy of type Sc.

Generally, the youngest stars, the extreme Population I, are found farther toward the center of a galaxy, and intermediate Population I stars are farther out. The Sun is an intermediate Population I star. Population I stars have regular elliptical orbits of the galactic centre, with a low relative velocity. It was hypothesized that the high metallicity of Population I stars makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than the other two populations, because planets, particularly terrestrial planets, are thought to be formed by the accretion of metals. However, observations of the Kepler data-set have found smaller planets around stars with a range of metallicities, while only larger, potential gas giant planets are concentrated around stars with relatively higher metallicity — a finding that has implications for theories of gas giant formation.

A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of blue-greens. Cyanobacteria remained principal primary producers throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. Green algae joined blue-greens as major primary producers on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–65 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form.

Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.

Evidence for the controlled use of fire by Homo erectus, beginning some 600,000 years ago, has wide scholarly support.

In the Neolithic evidence of early pottery appeared, as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths. Early rock art also first appeared in the Neolithic. The advent of metalworking in the Bronze Age brought additional media available for use in making art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as early writing systems.

Dyed flax fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia that date back to 36,000 BP.\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, anthropologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human body lice that suggests clothing originated quite recently, around 170,000 years ago. Body lice is an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern Homo sapiens away from the warm climate of Africa, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340).

There were two major areas of domestication: one in the area that is now Turkey, giving rise to the taurine line, and a second in the area that is now Pakistan, resulting in the indicine line. Modern mitochondrial DNA variation indicates the taurine line may have arisen from as few as 80 aurochs tamed in the upper reaches of Mesopotamia near the villages of Çayönü Tepesi in southeastern Turkey and Dja'de el-Mughara in northern Iraq.\nAlthough European cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from African cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern European cattle breeds and their New World descendants. A study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and Europe. Some researchers have suggested that African taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from North African aurochsen.","image":"Cattle","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/CH_cow_2_cropped.jpg/320px-CH_cow_2_cropped.jpg","imagename":"CH_cow_2_cropped.jpg","imageinfo":"'=={{int:filedesc}}=={{Information|description={{de|Kuh (Schweizer Braunvieh), unterhalb der Fuorcla Sesvenna im [[Switzerland|Schweizer]] [[Engadin]].}}{{en|Cow (Swiss Braunvieh breed), below Fuorcla Sesvenna in the [[Engadin]], [[Switzerland]].}}{{fr|'''Dandara'''(Brune Suisse ou Brune des Alpes) vue sous la Fuorcla Sesvenna dans l'[[Engadin]]e, en [[Switzerland|Suisse]].}}{{it|Mucca (Bruna Svizzera) sotto la Fuorcla Sesvenna nell'[[Engadin]]a, in [[Switzerland|Svizzera]].}}{{ca|Una [[:ca:vaca]] (Bruna Suïssa) als paratges [[Alps|alpins]] de la Fuorcla Sesvenna, a [[Engadin]], [[Suïssa]].}}{{es|Vaca (Parda Alpina), detrás [[Fuorcla Sesvenna]], en el valle de [[Engadin|Engadina]], [[Suiza]].}}|date=2007-07-26 11:29:12|source=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CH_cow_2.jpg|author=[[User:Dschwen|Daniel Schwen]]|permission=|other versions=<gallery>File:CH cow 2.jpg|uncropped</gallery>}}=={{int:license-header}}=={{cc-by-sa-3.0|Daniel Schwen}}{{GFDL|migration=redundant|Daniel Schwen}}[[Category:Uploaded with UploadWizard]][[Category:Engadin]][[Category:Braunvieh]][[Category:Cows]][[Category:Cattle in Switzerland]][[Category:July 2007 in Switzerland]][[Category:Files by User:Dschwen]][[Category:Taken with Canon EOS 5D]][[Category:Sleeping and resting bovines]][[Category:Sesvenna group]]","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":""},{"ago":"","since":"","year":"-5500","accuracy":"","name":"shoe","exclude":"","importance":"","icon":"shoe","category":"human","tags":"","wikimediakey":"Shoe#Antiquity","explanation":"","wikimedia":"The earliest known shoes are sandals dating from approximately 7000 or 8000 BC, found in the Fort Rock Cave in the US state of Oregon in 1938.

This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).\nThe Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is the first fully phonemic script. Thus the Phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and possibly Brahmic. Under a terminological distinction promoted by Peter T. Daniels, an \"alphabet\" is a script that represents both vowels and consonants as letters equally. In this narrow sense of the word the first \"true\" alphabet was the Greek alphabet, which was developed on the basis of the earlier Phoenician alphabet. In other alphabetic scripts such as the original Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic, letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants; such a script is also called an abjad. A third type, called abugida or alphasyllabary, is one where vowels are shown by diacritics or modifications of consonantal base letters, as in Devanagari and other South Asian scripts. The Khmer alphabet (for Cambodian) is the longest, with 74 letters.\nThere are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the Latin alphabet (which was derived from the Greek). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear writing), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille.","image":"Alphabet","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Orbis_eruditi_literatura_%C3%A0_charactere_Samaritico_deducta_1689.jpg/320px-Orbis_eruditi_literatura_%C3%A0_charactere_Samaritico_deducta_1689.jpg","imagename":"Orbis_eruditi_literatura_à_charactere_Samaritico_deducta_1689.jpg","imageinfo":"1=Orbis eruditi literatura à charactere Samaritico deducta","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":""},{"ago":"","since":"","year":"-1300","accuracy":"","name":"earliest stone arched bridge","exclude":"","importance":"","icon":"bridge","category":"human","tags":"","wikimediakey":"Arkadiko_Bridge","explanation":"","wikimedia":"The Arkadiko Bridge or Kazarma Bridge is a Mycenaean bridge near the modern road from Tiryns to Epidauros on the Peloponnese, Greece.

Perhaps the earliest still-unproven claim is that of archaeologist Bruce Masse, who putatively links an eclipse that occurred on May 10, 2807 BC with a possible meteor impact in the Indian Ocean on the basis of several ancient flood myths that mention a total solar eclipse.","image":"Solar_eclipse","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg/320px-Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg","imagename":"Solar_eclipse_1999_4_NR.jpg","imageinfo":"{{Assessments|enwiki=1|enwiki-nom=Image:Solar eclips 1999 4.jpg|trwiki=1|fawiki=1}}\r{{Picture of week on the Farsi Wikipedia|2|2011}}\r{{Information\r|Description={{en|Total Solar eclipse 1999 in France. * Additional noise reduction performed by [[User:Diliff|Diliff]].

The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the post-ancient world Aristarchus's Heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.\nIt was not until the 16th century that a geometric mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In the following century, Johannes Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.","image":"Heliocentrism","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/Heliocentric.jpg/320px-Heliocentric.jpg","imagename":"Heliocentric.jpg","imageinfo":"{{Information\r|Description = Heliocentric universe, Harmonia Macrocosmica\r|Source      = first upload to de:wikipedia  22:42, 5.

By the 13th century AD, the aurochs' range was restricted to Poland, Lithuania, Moldavia, Transylvania and East Prussia. The right to hunt large animals on any land was restricted first to nobles and then, gradually, to only the royal households. As the population of aurochs declined, hunting ceased, and the royal court used gamekeepers to provide open fields for grazing for the aurochs. The gamekeepers were exempted from local taxes in exchange for their service.

This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs.","image":"Dodo","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Oxford_Dodo_display.jpg/320px-Oxford_Dodo_display.jpg","imagename":"Oxford_Dodo_display.jpg","imageinfo":"{{Information\r|Description=Skeleton cast and model of dodo at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, based on modern research.[http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/learning/pdfs/dodo.pdf]\r|Source=[http://www.flickr.com/photos/bazzadarambler/5455776236/ Oxford University Museum of Natural History ... dodo - dead apparently.]\r* Uploaded by [[User:FunkMonk|FunkMonk]]\r|Date=2009-01-09 12:47\r|Author=[http://www.flickr.com/people/10390868@N07 BazzaDaRambler]\r|Permission=\r|other_versions=\r}}\r\r=={{int:license-header}}==\r{{cc-by-2.0}}\r{{flickrreview|File Upload Bot (Magnus Manske)|2012-06-27}}\r\r[[Category:Raphus cucullatus models]]\r[[Category:Raphus cucullatus skeletons]]","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":""},{"ago":"","since":"","year":"1687","accuracy":"","name":" Isaac Newton publishes 'Principia Mathematica'","exclude":"","importance":"","icon":"newton","category":"human","tags":"","wikimediakey":"Philosophiæ_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica","explanation":"","wikimedia":"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin for Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often referred to as simply the Principia, is a work in three books by Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published 5 July 1687.

Vaccination, the term which soon replaced cowpox inoculation and vaccine inoculation, was first used in print by Jenner's friend, Richard Dunning in 1800.

In Western Europe and the Americas, abolitionism is a historical movement to end the African and Indian slave trade and set slaves free. King Charles I of Spain, usually known as Emperor Charles V, following the example of the Swedish monarch, passed a law which would have abolished colonial slavery in 1542, although this law was not passed in the largest colonial states, and so was not enforced. In the late 17th century, the Roman Catholic Church, taking up a plea by Lourenco da Silva de Mendouca, officially condemned the slave trade, which was affirmed vehemently by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839. An abolitionist movement only started in the late 18th century, however, when English and American Quakers began to question the morality of slavery. James Oglethorpe was among the first to articulate the Enlightenment case against slavery, banning it in the Province of Georgia on humanist grounds, arguing against it in Parliament, and eventually encouraging his friends Granville Sharp and Hannah More to vigorously pursue the cause. Soon after his death in 1785, they joined with William Wilberforce and others in forming the Clapham Sect. The Somersett Case in 1772, which emancipated a slave in England, helped launch the British movement to abolish slavery. Though anti-slavery sentiments were widespread by the late 18th century, the colonies and emerging nations that used slave labour continued to do so: French, English and Portuguese territories in the West Indies; South America; and the Southern United States.","image":"Abolitionism","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Official_medallion_of_the_British_Anti-Slavery_Society_%281795%29.jpg/285px-Official_medallion_of_the_British_Anti-Slavery_Society_%281795%29.jpg","imagename":"Official_medallion_of_the_British_Anti-Slavery_Society_(1795).jpg","imageinfo":"'== {{int:filedesc}} ==\r{{Information\r|Description={{en|The Official Medallion of the British Anti-Slavery Society}}\r|Source=[http://www.users.muohio.edu/mandellc/projects/aronowml/ArtHome.htm British Abolition Movement]\r|Date=1795\r|Author=[[Josiah Wedgwood]] (1730-1795) and either William Hackwood or Henry Webber; \"Josiah Wedgewood...produced the emblem as a jasper-ware cameo at his pottery factory.

On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\". Fleming showed the contaminated culture to his former assistant Merlin Price, who reminded him, \"That's how you discovered lysozyme.\" Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the Penicillium genus, and, after some months of calling it \"mould juice\", named the substance it released penicillin on 7 March 1929. The laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum in St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington.","image":"penicillin","thumb":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Penicillin_core.svg/320px-Penicillin_core.svg.png","imagename":"Penicillin_core.svg","imageinfo":"'== {{int:filedesc}} ==\r{{Information\r|description={{en|1=chemical structure of the [[w:Penicillin|Penicillin]] core}}\r{{de|1=gemeinsame Struktur von Penicilinen}}\r|source={{own}}\r|author=[[User:Yikrazuul|Yikrazuul]]\r|date=2009-07-20\r|permission=\r|other versions=\r|other fields={{Igen|I|0|+|s=}}\r}}\r\r== {{int:license-header}} ==\r{{PD-chem}}\r{{PD-self}}\r\r[[Category:Penicillin antibiotics]]","wikijson":"","links":"","example":"","remark":""},{"ago":"","since":"","year":"1936","accuracy":"","name":"first computer","exclude":"","importance":"","icon":"computer","category":"human","tags":"","wikimediakey":"Z1_(computer):1","explanation":"","wikimedia":"The Z1 was the first freely programmable computer in the world which used Boolean logic and binary floating point numbers, however it was unreliable in operation.

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \"total war\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.
