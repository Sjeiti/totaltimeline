[{"name":"totaltimeline","copy":"TotalTimeLine is a timeline of everything. It is an open source project that tries to make people aware of their insignificance.\n\nThis timeline is not one to show historic events per se. It is a timeline of firsts. The depicted events are astronomical events, natural events or major accomplishments in the history of human kind.\nMost things in history are uncertain; either hearsay or speculation. So a lot of events are about the oldest -thing- we can see or have found, it does not nescesarilly mean the -thing- was not there before.\n\n## why\nI've never been much into the history they teach at schools. I did like dinosaurs, but society rather teaches you what wars your great-great-great-great-great grandfather fought.\nWhen a friend of mine told me he drew a timeline like this on paper and was awed by it I tried a similar one in code. The weirdest insight I got from this was that when you look at time like this life seems to emerge the moment the earth is created.\nLike a lot of things I code it this was just a rudimentary prototype I shelved. But this one nagged me in a sense that I think more people should know these facts. So I build it into something whole.\n[checkout holocene](#holocene)\n\n## collaboration\n\n## technical details\n* es5-shim\n* signals\n* iddqd\n* zen\n* hammerjs\n* markdown\n* twextwiki.js"}]
